# Final Project

## Running the Project

Compile `Mailbox.java` and then run the resulting `Mailbox.class` file.  This will open a window showing a prepopulated email.  Then click the "New Message" button to open a window to compose a new message.  

I was not able to implement all the functions by the deadline, but I used several advanced concepts that I researched on my own, including `enum`s, reading and writing CSV files, Regular Expressions, `switch` statements, `TimeZone` offsets, alternate epochs, and the Microsoft Excel date system.  Unfortunately, failing to add the final step of actually creating the email renders much of the work I did obsolete.
