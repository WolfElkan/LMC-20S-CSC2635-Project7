# Summary Questions

## Describe how you approached and solved the problem(s). 
## Where did you have trouble? How did you move forward? What topics still confuse you? 
## What did you learn from this assignment? (be specific)

I learned that I need to improve my workflow.  I need to make a functioning prototype first and modularize and improve second.  Perhaps I should build a skeleton of the application, with placeholder methods if necessary, and then fill them in from there.  My mistake during this project was to write methods and even whole classes that I thought would be used in the future, without first writing the logic that would *enable* them to be used.  

One aspect in which I did do this well was in the `onOpen()` and `onClose()` methods.  I wrote the logic that called these methods in the `Project.main` method while the methods themselves were still blank.  In the future, I should do this with all modules.

## If you worked in pairs, how did divide up the work?
